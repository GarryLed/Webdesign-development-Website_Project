# 1. Introduction
[Briefly describe what you have designed the site for and what it does]


The website I designed is an e-commerce site that sells video games, consoles, and gaming accessories. It allows users to login/logout with pre defined user details. Once a user is logged in they can

# 3. Installation/Usage
[Add in here any specific details that will allow the lecturer to test your work – e.g. Username/password combo to “allow” login of the prototype. Also add in any missing elements, functionality not working, etc]

# 5. Performance
[Explain what you have done to improve the performance of your site, and any changes you could make for a production site.]

I imporved performance of the site in a few ways: 
1. Loading CSS at the top of each page, but loading JavaScript at the bottom of each page, which will help the pages load faster.
2. Minifiying CSS/JS files 
3. Optimizing images by resizing them and makeing them smaller

1. Image optimisation 
2. Meta tags 
3. Title optimisation for each page
4. Meta Description 
5. Keywords on each page 
6. Page speed 
7. Image alt text 


# 7. Accessibility
[Explain what you have done to make your site accessible. Illustrate with screenshot examples from your code]
1. Image alt text 
2. Labels on all the forms 
3. Descriptive URL's 


# 8. Wireframes
[If the paper wireframes that you presented in early November are different to the finished website – explain briefly why this is so? What could you have done differently?]
- add wireframes here

# 9. Reflection on your work

Write briefly under the following headings:
#### What went well?

#### What did not go well and if so what would you differently?
