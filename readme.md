# 4. Design Decisions Made
[For each of the following state briefly what you did and why you did it]

## 4.1 Look and Feel
[Describe what how you have applied Bootstrap to your site or any customisations you have made toward the end of the project]

- Dark mode 


## 4.2 Breakpoints
[List the major breakpoints in your work  and describe what  changes at the breakpoint. Did you implement any minor tweaks at these breakpoints using media query techniques? e.g. font size changes, hiding of content, responsive images using srcset, etc?]

# 5. Performance

- add wireframes here

# 9. Reflection on your work

Write briefly under the following headings:
#### What went well?

#### What did not go well and if so what would you differently?

#### Did you do anything in this project that was not covered in this module, maybe it was covered in another module? Maybe you applied something you learning from your own research?

- Dark mode 

# Deliverables 
## Overall Aim
The overall goal is to produce a working, fully featured, sensible website that sells a
product or service online:
- [x] selling a product online
- [ ] making a reservation/booking
- [ ] getting a delivery
## Deliverables
Main deliverable is a working web site which uses Bootstrap 5.3. The site must be
designed from a mobile first perspective and should be fully responsive.
- [ ] Your site should work in all the major browsers – you will need to test on
Chrome and Edge.
- [ ] The site should be designed to work well in all screen sizes, with appropriate
content and layout for major breakpoints.
The key dates for these deliverables are noted specifically in Moodle, all of these
deliverables will also be uploaded to Moodle (zip files)
- [ ] Wireframe and Project Proposal
- [ ] Fully completed project (source files + Project report)
Content
- [x] Home, Contact, About Us, Shop (with product catalogue of at least 6 items),
Login/Register
- [ ] User Registration - Forms on the site will in include Login, Register, Forgot Password –
so a user can register on the site.
- [ ] Other forms relating to user registration could include personal details and billing
address/delivery address – as long as these are relevant to the service being delivered.
- [ ] Check out page
Design and Layout
- [ ] Menu must be obvious and appropriate for the viewport size.
- [ ] Images should be delivered in appropriate formats and resolutions.
- [ ] You can include other advanced features from Bootstrap 5.3 (e.g. carousel on home
page of top selling products) or elsewhere – as long it is appropriate to the site.
## Tools you will use
- [x] Boostrap 5.3, CSS customisations/SASS
- [ ] Javascript
- [ ] Use LocalStorage object(getItem,setItem) for persisting data and state from page to
page on your site. You will use this in conjunction with JSON.stringify() and
JSON.parse().
## User Flow
Outlined below is the user journey that is expected from your project. You may refine this
yourselves to add extra functionality and this is also fine.
- [ ] Navigate to the home page of the site – know immediately from the content and the
logo on the screen what this site is selling/producing/offering.
- [ ] I look to the contact details for this store – do they look reputable? Do they provide
address contact details/map to show where they are located. Is there a contact form
so I can get in touch with them about my order?
- [ ] I look to the About section of the site – I want to find out a little more about this
company? Who are they?
- [ ] Finally I browse to the Shop or product catalogue on the site. It has at least 6
offerings for sale – so I know they must be genuine.
- [ ] The products/services are laid out well. There is a title, image, short description;
where relevant there are a few images of the product.
- [ ] Depending on the product/service being offered – there may be options associated
with it; for example small, medium, large or maybe there are different colours? Or
maybe the quantity? But you should only add these options if you want to get top
marks!!!
- [ ] I’m happy with the product I have chosen – so now I click “Add to Cart”; I see that the
Items is now set at 1 in my cart – and the cost of the total items has also jumped
accordingly.
- [ ] I go to the checkout. I see that my delivery address has been defaulted in
automatically from my address given in my personal details.
- [ ] I enter in dummy credit card detail
- [ ] I click “Submit Payment” – and then a message appears on screen “Thank you for
your order”.
Background to the User Flow
- [ ] You will use Javascript arrays to store details associated with a “registered” user –
username, email, password, address, etc.; this means for example that during a
session the user could pretend to update their address – and this change would be
saved for the duration of the session
- [ ] For the user login screen – to easily allow testing for a registered user – use the
value field for username and password to automatically default in a valid username
and password for using the site; if these details were adjusted while testing – then
the user would not be able to see personal details, etc..
- [ ] You could use Javascript arrays to store details of the products in your catalogue.
Project : Web Design & Development, Year 2 Semester 1
- [ ]  You will have a minimum of 6 products or so to sell. You can have an individual
product page for each item if you wish. However you will probably just have one
overall shop page which displays all of your products on one page.
